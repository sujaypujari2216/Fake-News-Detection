# Fake-News-Detection
Fake news also termed as Junk news, pseudo-news or hoax news is the form of news consisting of deliberate disinformation spread via traditional news media or online social media. This is often done to further or impose certain ideas and is often achieved with political agendas.
To detect fake news, I am using TF-IDF and Passive-Aggressive Classifier- it is an algorithm that remains passive for a correct classification outcome and turns aggressive in the event of misclassification and updates itself.
